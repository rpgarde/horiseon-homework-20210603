# horiseon-homework-20210603
This is my submission for the Code Refactor homework, due 3 June 2021. 

I made the following edits that correspond with the acceptance criteria. Note that the HTML and CSS files all have detailed comments of my changes, so you can look there as well.

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

- I used semantic elements such as header, footer, section, main, etc. 

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- I attempted to format the file as best as I can to make it more readable, and following the flow of the positions

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

- I added alt attributes to all iamges in the html file

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

- I edited footer to be h4 so that the heading attributes fell in sequential order 

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

- I changed the title to Horiseon Social Solution Services

In addition to the acceptance criteria, I ensured to do the following: 
- On the search engine optimization section, there was no "id", which was causing the link to not work, so I added that 
- I reorganised the CSS file so all the elements were grouped together, for ease of code readability
- I made this README and published this page to Github as part of the grading criteria
